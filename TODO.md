# Stuff
- [ ] Optimize it. Im looking rn through the code and i see that a lot of stuff is repeating which means that the optimization is pretty bad

# Bugs
- [ ] calling af:update manually in love.update returns error(i guess its something related too ... and dt)
- [ ] Stop using the fucntions automatically if they're used automatically(eg. if af:draw() is drawn in the love.draw manually then stop drawing it automatically, you can ask an boolean for that in the af:draw(bool value))
