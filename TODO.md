# Stuff

# Bugs
- [ ] calling af:update manually in love.update returns error(i guess its something related too ... and dt)

# Done
- [x] Optimize it. Im looking rn through the code and i see that a lot of stuff is repeating which means that the optimization is pretty bad
- [x] Maybe remove the order system and make the love functions working along with autofuncs
